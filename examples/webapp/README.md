# Yew Trunk Template

### Installation

If you don't already have it installed, it's time to install Rust: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.
The rest of this guide assumes a typical Rust installation which contains both `rustup` and Cargo.

### Initialization

```bash
just init
```

That's it, we're done!

### Running

```bash
just serve
```

Rebuilds the app whenever a change is detected and runs a local server to host it.
